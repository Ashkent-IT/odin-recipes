    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>3 large eggs(beaten)</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon hot sauce</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon Worcestershire sauce</li>
        <li>2 1/2 cups all-purpose flour</li>
        <li>3 tablespoons cornstarch</li>
        <li>3 tablespoons seasoned salt</li>
        <li>2 teaspoons paprika</li>
        <li>1/2 teaspoon cayenne pepper</li>
        <li>2 teaspoons black pepper</li>
        <li>1/2 teaspoon garlic powder</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon onion powder</li>
        <li>8 pieces chicken</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>In a medium sized bowl, whisk together eggs, hot sauce and worcestershire and set aside.</li>
        <li>Next add flour, cornstarch, seasoned salt, paprika, cayenne pepper, black pepper, garlic powder and onion powder to a paper bag and shake to mix well.</li>
        <li>Dip each piece of chicken into egg wash coating both sides then dip into seasoned flour thoroughly coating each piece. Then add piece to baking sheet to rest.</li>
        <li>Finish coating all chicken and let sit for 10-15 minutes until coating has set.</li>
        <li>While coating sets, add 1-1/2 inches of oil to a cast iron skillet or heavy bottom skillet and heat over medium high heat. Also turn on oven to 275 degrees.</li>
        <li>This is my test for knowing when the oil is ready: Big Mama always tossed a tiny bit of flour in the oil and if it began to fry and sizzle, the oil was ready.</li>
        <li>Fry four pieces at a time on each side starting with dark meat since it takes longer. Make sure you don’t overcrowd the pan.</li>
        <li>After each side has turned slightly golden, put the top on the skillet to steam the inside of the chicken ensuring doneness. After a couple of minutes, remove the top and continue to fry until the crust is crispy again and completely golden brown.</li>
        <li>Remove chicken from oil and place on paper towels or rack to drain. Place chicken on a baking sheet covered with parchment and add to warmed oven while finishing the other chicken pieces.</li>
        <li>Fry the remaining chicken pieces and drain and add to oven. Add the remaining chicken to the oven.</li>
        <li>Serve when ready.</li>
    </ol>
