    <p>Rooted in Roman culinary tradition, carbonara reflects Italy’s love for honest cooking and high-quality ingredients. It is a dish often enjoyed in homes and local trattorias, where technique matters as much as taste. Each bite feels comforting yet refined, showing how a few well-chosen ingredients can create something truly special. Traditional carbonara continues to charm people around the world, offering a warm and satisfying taste of Italy’s food culture.</p>

    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>3 cups cooked spaghetti (about 10 ounces dry)</li>
        <li>4 large egg yolks</li>
        <li>1 cup pecorino freshly grated</li>
        <li>1/2 to 1 teaspoon black pepper (freshly ground if possible)</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons olive oil</li>
        <li>1/2 to 3/4 cup guanciale</li>
    </ul>
    <p>EXTRAS</p>
    <ul>
        <li>2 to 3 tablespoons pecorino freshly grated</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>In a large pot boil the water, once the water is at a roaring boil add a little salt and the spaghetti, stir and cook until a little bit more than al dente.</li>
        <li>In a small/medium bowl beat until well combined the egg yolks, add the grated pecorino and pepper, beat to combine. Just before adding to the pan add ⅓ – ½ cup (80-120ml) of hot pasta water and mix to combine well.</li>
        <li>Slice the guanciale into short thin strips. In a large pan add the olive oil and guanciale, cook on medium heat until desired doneness, I like it on the crunchy side, the Italian not so much. Remove the guanciale to a clean plate. Do not remove the oil (& fat) from the pan.</li>
        <li>On medium/high heat, add the al dente pasta to the pan, and a ⅓-½ cup (80-120 ml) of hot pasta water and stir to combine,  remove the pan from the heat and add the egg mixture and quickly combine, add ⅓ -½ cup of hot (not boiling) pasta water and toss continually until well combined and creamy. </li>
        <li>Add the guanciale and gently mix.  Serve immediately topped with freshly grated pecorino and black pepper. Enjoy!</li>
